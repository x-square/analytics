### Psychology for better user experience

Humans have a built-in way of understanding the world, and psychology helps us understand it better. Researchers and designers can apply this knowledge to fashion user-friendly experiences. Rather than expecting users to adjust to a design, we can use psychology principles as a compass to craft designs that align seamlessly with human nature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Psychology concepts

-   **Mental model** is like a personal guide in our minds that helps us understand and predict how things work. We build it from what we've experienced and learned. It simplifies complex stuff, making it easier to understand and make decisions about the world around us. It's like our inner map for navigating our surroundings.

-   **Conceptual model** is like a simplified explanation of how something functions. It's typically created based on a person's experiences, training, or instruction. This model helps individuals understand and make sense of complex systems or processes by breaking them down into more understandable and simplified representations. In essence, it's a mental framework that aids in comprehending how something works, even if the real system is more intricate.

-   **Cognitive load** refers to the mental effort a person experiences when processing information or performing tasks, often measured by the amount of working memory resources used. Reducing cognitive load is crucial for creating user-friendly interfaces. This is achieved by simplifying tasks, presenting information clearly, minimising choices, maintaining consistency, providing feedback, and using user feedback to refine designs.

-   **Working memory** is the brain's ability to temporarily hold and manipulate a limited amount of information for a short period. It serves as a mental workspace for immediate tasks and problem-solving, with a small capacity and short duration. This cognitive function is vital for activities requiring concentration, reasoning, and the temporary retention of information.

-   **Chunking** is a cognitive process that involves breaking down a large amount of information into smaller, more manageable groups or chunks. These chunks are then organised in a meaningful way to make it easier for the brain to process and remember the information. It is a valuable strategy for enhancing memory and cognitive performance in various contexts.

-   **Bias** in user experience refers to subjective preferences or stereotypes that can influence the design and evaluation of digital products, potentially leading to unequal or unfair experiences for certain user groups. To address bias, diverse teams, thorough user research, accessibility considerations, testing with real users, data-driven decisions, and ethical guidelines are essential. Mitigating bias is crucial for creating inclusive and user-friendly products that serve a diverse user base fairly.

-   **Cognitive bias** refers to recurring patterns of errors in our thinking and decision-making that can influence how we perceive the world. These biases can lead us to make judgments that may not always be rational or objective. Understanding cognitive biases is crucial for making more informed and objective decisions in various aspects of life.

-   **Cognitive dissonance** happens when a user feels puzzled or uncomfortable because they expect something to work a certain way in an interface, but it behaves differently, giving unexpected results. It's important for designers to prevent this to ensure a smooth user experience.

-   **Selective attention** is a vital cognitive process. It allows individuals to concentrate on particular information, filtering out the irrelevant bits. This helps manage sensory input efficiently, enhancing perception and cognition. For example, website visitors tend to ignore content that resembles ads or is placed in typical ad locations.

-   **Analysis paralysis** is when a person struggles to make decisions because they've overanalysed a problem, leading to inaction. This occurs when excessive data gathering and consideration prevent decision-making. To combat it, setting criteria, deadlines, and seeking input from others can help simplify complex decisions and avoid prolonged indecision.

-   **Flow** is a mental state marked by deep immersion, intense focus, and enjoyment in an activity. It occurs when the challenge of the task matches an individual's skill level, creating a fulfilling and rewarding experience. Flow is associated with heightened creativity, productivity, and a sense of accomplishment, making it a sought-after state for personal and professional growth.

-   **Paradox of choice** means that when people are given too many options, it can be stressful and confusing for them to make a decision. This concept is applied to avoid overwhelming users. Designers achieve this by carefully selecting a smaller set of choices for users and providing tools to help them filter and decide. This simplifies the decision-making process and leads to a better user experience.

#### User interaction

-   **Consistency** means keeping things in a design uniform and predictable. This includes elements like buttons, fonts, and colours. By doing this, users can expect a familiar and expected experience, making it easier for them to understand and use the product or interface.

-   **Standards** are guidelines that help make products and interfaces better. These guidelines cover things like how things should look, how easy they should be to use, and how safe they should be. Following these guidelines makes products more user-friendly and reliable, benefiting both users and companies.

-   **Visibility** means making sure that important elements and options are easily seen and reachable. Users should not have to search for information or features. They should be readily available and obvious. This ensures a smoother and more user-friendly experience.

-   **Feedback** means giving users prompt and useful information to acknowledge that their actions have been noted and to guide them as they interact with the interface. It helps users understand what's happening and makes their experience more user-friendly.

-   **Simplicity** means creating designs that are straightforward and easy to understand. It involves avoiding unnecessary complexity that might confuse users or make tasks more challenging. The goal is to make the user experience clear and user-friendly.

-   **Hierarchy** involves arranging information and elements in a logical order of importance. This makes it simple for users to navigate and grasp the structure of the interface. By prioritising and structuring content effectively, users can easily find what they need, improving their overall experience.

-   **Aesthetics** refers to how something looks and feels, especially in design. When it comes to interfaces, it means making them visually appealing. However, it's important to keep in mind that aesthetics should not make the interface difficult to use. In other words, while making it look good is important, it shouldn't sacrifice usability, meaning it should still be easy and practical for users to navigate and interact with.

-   **Minimalist design** is an approach that simplifies design by using only essential elements, often with ample whitespace and a limited colour palette. It prioritises clean typography, focuses on content, maintains balance and proportion, and emphasises functionality. This design style is known for its simplicity, elegance, and ability to draw attention to core information or features.

-   **Flexibility** means giving users the option to adapt their experience to their liking. This could include allowing them to change settings or preferences within a digital product. It's about offering users the freedom to tailor the product to their needs and preferences, which can enhance their overall satisfaction and usability.

-   **Efficiency** means making things work smoothly and quickly for users. It involves simplifying the steps and interactions required for users to complete tasks, so they can get things done with minimal effort and in a shorter time. In design, efficiency helps enhance the user experience by reducing frustration and making the process more user-friendly.

-   **Error handling** involves designing a digital product with the aim of preventing errors whenever possible. However, when errors do occur, it means providing users with clear and informative error messages that help them understand what went wrong. Additionally, error handling includes creating pathways for users to recover from mistakes smoothly and continue using the product without frustration. It's about making the user experience forgiving and user-friendly even when errors happen.

-   **Learnability** is all about how easy it is for users, especially new ones, to figure out how to use an interface or a product. It involves making the learning process smooth and user-friendly. This can be achieved by providing clear onboarding steps and helpful resources when needed. In essence, it ensures that users can quickly understand how to use a system, making their initial experience more enjoyable and less confusing.

-   **Context** involves taking into account the circumstances and surroundings in which users will engage with your product or interface. This includes understanding the user's environment and the device they are using. By considering context, you can tailor the design to better suit the specific conditions in which it will be used. This can lead to a more user-friendly and effective experience, as the design can adapt to the user's needs and surroundings.

-   **Discoverability** refers to how easily users can find out what a system or interface does, how it functions, and what actions or operations are available to them. It's about making sure that users can quickly and intuitively explore and understand the capabilities of a system without having to guess or struggle to figure it out. A design with good discoverability guides users effectively, helping them uncover and utilise its features, resulting in a more user-friendly experience.

-   **Affordances** are like invitations in design. They're visual or sensory clues that suggest what actions can be taken with an object or interface. For example, a button's raised appearance invites you to press it. Affordances make it clear how you can interact with something without the need for detailed instructions, making designs more user-friendly.

-   **Signifiers** are like clear signs or cues in a design. They provide visible or audible indications of what actions are appropriate within a system or interface. Signifiers help users understand where and how to interact with elements. For example, a click here link is a signifier that explicitly indicates where to click. Signifiers make it easier for users to know how to engage with a system or interface, improving usability and user experience.

-   **Mapping** refers to how the elements of one set relate to the elements of another set. It's about establishing a connection or relationship between these sets of things. In design and user experience, mapping can be used to show how physical or digital elements correspond to each other, making it easier for users to understand and interact with a system or interface. It's like creating a clear and logical link between two sets of information or objects.

-   **Familiarity** means something is known or recognised because you've encountered it before. In various contexts, like design and branding, it's important because people tend to feel more comfortable and trust things they are familiar with. For example, a familiar layout on a website or a familiar logo on a product can make users feel at ease and more likely to engage with it.

-   **Recognition rather than recall** is a usability principle in interface design. It suggests that users should be able to recognise information or options in an interface instead of having to rely on their memory to recall them. This principle promotes clarity through clear labels, visual cues, consistency, and simplification of cognitive load, making interfaces more user-friendly and intuitive.

-   **Constraints** are like rules or limits that guide our actions and interpretations in various contexts. They can be physical (the properties of objects), semantic (the meaning of symbols), cultural (based on cultural norms), or logical (governed by system rules). Constraints help us understand and use things correctly, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.

-   **Controllability** refers to the degree to which a user can influence or manage a situation, process, or system. Users should have the power to control and navigate the system according to their preferences and needs. This includes the capacity to make choices, initiate actions, and customise settings. A high degree of controllability ensures that users feel in charge and can use the system effectively, tailoring it to their requirements.

-   **Freedom** means providing users with the flexibility to explore, interact, and make decisions within a system or application without unnecessary constraints. It implies that users should feel free to experiment without the fear of making irreversible errors. Designing for freedom involves offering clear and accessible options for users to undo actions, correct mistakes, and move around the interface fluidly. This freedom encourages users to explore and engage with the system confidently.

-   **Terminology-free** means explaining something without using complicated or technical words. It's about using plain and easy-to-understand language so that everyone can grasp the information easily.

-   **Help and documentation** involves providing users with resources like user manuals, online guides, and FAQs to assist them in understanding how to use a product or system effectively and troubleshoot issues. It ensures a positive user experience and helps users get the support they need.

-   **Gestalt principles** are rules for how we visually perceive and organise information. They include principles like completing shapes, grouping similar elements, seeing smooth lines, distinguishing objects from backgrounds, valuing symmetry, and simplifying complex shapes. These principles are essential in design for creating attractive and clear visuals.

#### User goals

-   **Findability** is all about how easily people can locate information or content within a website, app, or system. It's about making sure users can quickly and effortlessly find what they're looking for, which contributes to a better overall user experience. Think of it as a measure of how well something helps users find what they need.

-   **Accessibility** means making sure that everyone, including those with disabilities, can easily use and interact with a design or digital product. It involves following specific guidelines and standards to ensure that people with various abilities can access and use the interface without barriers. This inclusive approach is essential for creating a user-friendly and considerate experience for all users.

-   **Usability** is about how easy and effective it is for people to use a product or system. It involves whether users can accomplish tasks easily, learn to use it quickly, and feel satisfied with their experience. In essence, usability is all about making things user-friendly.

-   **Credibility** means making users trust the product. This involves providing accurate information, ensuring the product works reliably, and giving users confidence to use it comfortably. Credibility is vital for a positive user experience.

-   **Desirability** refers to the quality of a product or service that makes people want to use it. It's about creating an emotional connection and appeal that goes beyond mere functionality. Desirable products or experiences often evoke positive feelings, such as satisfaction, enjoyment, or a sense of delight in users. In simpler terms, desirability means making something not just useful but also attractive and appealing to users, so they genuinely want to engage with it.

-   **Valuable product or service** is something that is really important and helpful to users. It means it effectively meets their needs or provides benefits that they truly like and find worthwhile. In simple terms, if something is seen as valuable, it's highly important and useful for specific purposes.

#### Laws of user experience

-   **Aesthetic-usability effect** means that when something looks nice, people often assume it's easy to use, even if they haven't tried it. It shows that aesthetics can impact how users think about a product's usability.

-   **Doherty threshold** is a guideline in computer interaction. It suggests that for optimal user-computer interaction, the response time between the user's action and the computer's response should be under 400 milliseconds. When interactions happen at this speed, it leads to a more efficient and satisfying experience because neither the user nor the computer has to wait for each other.

-   **Fitts' law** states that the time it takes for a person to point at or click on a target like a button or icon is influenced by two factors: the distance to the target and the size of the target. In simpler terms, if a target is closer or bigger, it's quicker and easier to interact with. This law helps designers optimise the placement and size of elements to make user interactions more efficient and effective.

-   **Goal-gradient effect** means that when you're close to achieving a goal, you tend to work even harder to reach it. It's like a boost of motivation as you get nearer to your target. This effect is often used to encourage people to take action and make progress towards their goals.

-   **Hick's law** is about how the more choices you have, the longer it takes to make a decision. It's a reminder to keep things simple to speed up decision-making.

-   **Jakob's law** or the **law of least astonishment** in web design means that people prefer websites that look and work like ones they've used before. It's about making websites familiar and easy to use by following common design patterns.

-   **Law of common region** says that when things are inside a visible boundary, we think they're part of the same group. Designers use this to make information neat and easy to understand.

-   **Law of proximity** means that when things are close to each other, we tend to think they are related or belong together. Designers use this to arrange elements in a way that shows connections and relationships.

-   **Law of uniform connectedness** says that when things in a design are visually connected, we tend to think they're more related. Designers use this to show connections between elements.

-   **Law of similarity** means that when things in a picture look the same, our brains often group them together, even if they're not close. This helps in creating patterns and making information clear and easy to understand.

-   **Law of grouping** says that our brains tend to organise things based on patterns. For example, if you see a bunch of dots, you might naturally group them to form shapes or lines. This helps us make sense of what we see.

-   **Law of Prägnanz**, also known as the **law of simplicity**, states that people simplify complex or unclear images to save mental effort. When things are confusing, our brains naturally make them as simple as possible. Designers use this to create clear visuals that users can understand quickly and easily.

-   **Miller's law** means that most people can remember about 7±2 things in their working memory. This helps us understand how much information people can hold in their minds at once.

-   **Occam's razor** is a problem-solving principle that means when you have several possible explanations for something, the simplest one is usually the right one. It's about choosing the easiest and most straightforward answer that makes sense."

-   **Pareto principle**, also known as the **80/20 rule** or the **law of the vital few**, is a concept that suggests that roughly 80% of results or effects come from 20% of causes or efforts. In simpler terms, it means that a small portion of your actions or inputs often leads to the majority of your outcomes or results. This principle is used in various contexts, such as business and time management, to focus efforts on the most productive or impactful activities.

-   **Parkinson's law** means that work often takes as long as you give it, even if it could be done faster. So, setting reasonable deadlines is important to avoid unnecessary delays.

-   **Postel's law**, also known as the **robustness principle**, means that when you send information, be specific and precise, but when you receive information, be flexible and open-minded. It's a guideline for making sure different systems can work together on the internet.

-   **Peak-end rule** says we remember experiences mainly by how they felt at their most intense moment and how they ended, rather than the whole experience. It shows that these moments have a big impact on our memories.

-   **Serial position effect** is about how we remember things in a list. We tend to remember the first and last items better, but the ones in the middle are harder to recall. This is important when trying to remember information or when creating presentations.

-   **Tesler's law**, also known as the **law of conservation of complexity**, suggests that as you add new features to a design, you should try to simplify or balance the complexity in other parts of the design. In other words, there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced. This helps ensure that the overall usability and user experience remain good even as a design becomes more feature-rich.

-   **Von Restorff effect**, also known as the **isolation effect**, means that if something is different from the rest, it's more likely to be remembered. It shows that unique or standout things tend to stick in our memory.

-   **Zeigarnik effect** is when you tend to remember things you started but didn't finish better than things you completed. It's like unfinished tasks stick in your memory more.

-   **Campbell's law** means that when a measurement is very important in making decisions, people are more likely to try and change or manipulate that measurement to their benefit, even if it's not entirely accurate. It warns us to be careful when using critical metrics in decision-making.

-   **Stroop effect** is a delay in reaction time when words are written in a colour that doesn't match their meaning. For example, saying red when the word blue is written in red ink. This happens because our brains really want to read the word, which can slow us down in naming the ink colour. It's a way to study how our mind works.

-   **Simon effect** is like a game where you have two buttons, one on the left and one on the right. If something appears on the left, your brain wants you to press the left button, and if it's on the right, your brain says press the right button. Even if you try not to, your brain still wants you to press the button that matches where the thing showed up. It's a way scientists learn about how our brains work.

-   **Accot-Zhai steering law** helps computer designers make it easier for users to move the cursor on screens. It depends on two things: how far you're going and how big the target is. If it's far or small, it takes longer to get there. If it's close or big, you get there faster. This law aims to create user-friendly computer interfaces. Also, letting the cursor move diagonally between menus prevents accidental closures.

-   **Law of closure** is a concept that says our brains like to complete shapes, even if they're not fully drawn. So, if you see a partly drawn circle, your brain will see it as a complete circle.

-   **Law of closure in storytelling** means that when a story leaves some things unexplained or open-ended, your brain naturally tries to fill in the gaps and make sense of it. It's like finishing a puzzle by adding the missing pieces in your mind.

-   **Law of continuity** is about how our brains prefer things to flow smoothly without interruptions. When elements are connected without breaks, our brains see them as one continuous pattern.

-   **Paradox of the active user** suggests that even when users could save time by learning and improving a system, they often don't bother to do so. It's like saying you could get better at something if you put in some effort, but many people choose not to.

-   **Principle of least effort** means that people usually pick the easiest way to do things to save time and energy. It's like taking the simplest route to work to avoid traffic because it's less effort.

-   **Law of past experience** says that what we've experienced before affects how we act and think now. For example, if you like a brand's product before, you're likely to choose it again.

-   **Law of context** says that where and when we do something affects how we do it. For example, how you behave at work is different from how you act at a party.

-   **Moore's law** says that computer chips get smaller and more powerful every two years. This makes our devices faster and cheaper. It's why technology keeps improving so quickly.

-   **Metcalfe's law** says that the more people or devices are in a network, the more valuable it becomes. For example, a social media platform is more useful when more people join because there are more connections and interactions. So, more users make a network much more valuable.

-   **Fogg behavior model** explains why people do things. It says for an action to happen, you need motivation, ability, and a trigger. If any of these is missing or weak, the action won't occur. It's used to design things that make it easier for people to do what you want, like using an app or buying a product.

-   **F-pattern** for reading web content is how most people quickly scan a webpage. They first look across the top, then a bit below, and finally, they scan down the left side. It's important for web designers to put the most important information where people are likely to look first and make content easy to skim.

-   **Google golden triangle** is where most people look first on a search results page. They check the top result, then the second and third ones. It's called a triangle because of the shape their eyes make when reading these top spots. Websites want to be in this area because that's where users usually click.

-   **Long neck theory** means it's profitable to sell many different, less popular things to niche markets instead of just a few popular items. It's about offering variety and serving diverse interests.

-   **Law of locality** is a computer rule that says it's faster to use data that's stored close together in memory. It's like having a bookshelf where you keep the pages you need next to each other, so you don't have to keep moving around to find them. This helps computers work more efficiently.

-   **Weber's law** says that your ability to notice a change in something depends on how big that change is compared to the starting point. If the starting point is small, even a small change is noticeable. But if the starting point is big, you need a bigger change to notice it. This idea is used in psychology to understand how we perceive differences in things like brightness or weight.

-   **Fechner's law** says that our perception of a change in something, like brightness or loudness, doesn't match the actual change in a straight line. Instead, our perception increases more gradually as the physical change gets bigger. It helps explain how our senses work when we notice things like a brighter light or a louder sound.

-   **Law of experiential gradients** means that our feelings and reactions can change as we go through an experience or from one stage to another. It's like how our emotions can shift while watching a movie, from curiosity to excitement and then satisfaction.

-   **Law of conservation of detail** means that in storytelling or design, you should include only the essential information or elements. Don't add unnecessary stuff that can confuse or distract from the main point. It's like making a recipe with just the right ingredients, not too many.

-   **Law of recency** says that we tend to remember and give more importance to things we've encountered or experienced recently. For example, if you've just heard something, it's more likely to stick in your mind than something you heard a while ago.

-   **Law of expectation** says that what we expect to happen influences how we see things. For example, if we expect something to be good, we're more likely to notice the good parts and overlook the bad. In user experience design, it's important to match what users expect to create a positive experience.

-   **Law of navigation** is like having clear signs and roads in a city. In a website or app, it means making sure there are easy-to-find menus and buttons so users can quickly go where they want to.
