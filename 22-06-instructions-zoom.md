`This document introduces what to expect when attending remote user interviews`

## Key points

When joining an interview, the most important rules are to:

-   **MUTE** your microphone
-   Turn your video **OFF**
-   Change your name to **VIEWER**
-   **REMOVE** your profile picture

## Before the interview

Three things you should receive in order to dial in via Zoom to attend a remote interview:

1.  **Meeting link**: starting with `https://globant.zoom.us`
2.  **Meeting ID**: between 9 and 11 digits
3.  **Meeting passcode**: 6 characters

Before each session starts or at the start of the day, we will share relevant information about the participant joining the next session via WhatsApp, Slack or email.

## What to expect when entering the meeting room?

There are a few things we recommend to do and watch out for when you enter the meeting room:

1.  **Start time**: Please join at least 10 minutes before if possible to ensure that your camera and microphone are set off. The interviews often start on time.
2.  **Who is attending**: You will see the moderator, anonymous note-taker, participant and viewers.
3.  **Recording**: All the sessions will be recorded.
4.  **Avoid distraction**: You must mute yourself, change your name to viewer and remove your profile photo, in order not to put pressure on the participant.
5.  **Avoid interruption**: Do not unmute yourself or use the Zoom chat whilst a session is in progress.
6.  **Questions**: If you have additional questions for the participant, please put them in the WhatsApp group chat or Slack channel.
7.  **Discussion guide**: The discussion guide is not a verbatim script. When needed, the order and questions may be adjusted accordingly by the moderator.
8.  **Attendance**: The thoughts, feelings and experiences of each participant can be very different. We suggest you not make assumptions based on listening to one participant. Attend as many sessions as you can to benefit from these different learnings.
