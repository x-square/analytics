The interviews often start on time.2.  **Who is attending**: You will see the moderator, anonymous note-taker, participant and viewers.3.  **Recording**: All the sessions will be recorded.4.  **Avoid distraction**: You must mute yourself, change your name to viewer and remove your profile photo, in order not to put pressure on the participant.85.  **Avoid interruption**: Do not unmute yourself or use the Google Meet chat whilst a session is in progress.6.  **Questions**: If you have additional questions for the participant, please put them in the WhatsApp group chat or Slack channel.7.  **Discussion guide**: The discussion guide is not a verbatim script. When needed, the order and questions may be adjusted accordingly by the moderator.8.  **Attendance**: The thoughts, feelings and experiences of each participant can be very different. We suggest you not make assumptions based on listening to one participant. Attend as many sessions as you can to benefit from these different learnings.## How to join with Google Meet?You will be able to dial in on a web browser without downloading an app.### Step-by-step guidelines:1.  Copy the meeting link into a web browser with a **private** (Safari) or **incognito** (Google Chrome) window.

Alternatively, you can sign out of all your Google accounts beforehand. Please note that you will be unable to change your name and remove your profile picture when joining with your account signed in.2.  Click **Allow** when you are prompted to allow `meet.google.com` to use your camera and microphone.3.  Select **Turn off microphone** and **Turn off camera**.4.  Put down **Viewer** as your display name.5.
