# Analytics

Analytics is the systematic analysis of data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making. It involves collecting, processing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform strategies and actions. Analytics can be applied in various fields, including business, healthcare, finance, and social sciences, to improve performance, optimise processes, and enhance understanding of complex systems.

## Chronological levels of analytics

- **Descriptive analytics** focuses on summarising historical data to understand what has happened in the past. It provides insights into trends, patterns, and performance metrics. Common analyses include **funnel analysis**, **customer segmentation**, and **trend analysis**. For example, a company might use descriptive analytics to analyse sales data from the previous year to identify seasonal trends and customer preferences.
- **Diagnostic analytics** is a type of analytics that focuses on understanding the reasons behind past events or outcomes. It goes beyond descriptive analytics by analysing historical data to identify patterns and relationships that explain why certain events occurred. Common analyses include **root cause analysis**, **session replays**, and **A/B testing**. For example, a company might use diagnostic analytics to investigate a sudden drop in sales by examining customer feedback, market trends, and competitor actions. It helps to find the causes of friction like **interactive friction**, **cognitive friction**, and **emotional friction**.
- **Predictive analytics** uses statistical models and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. It helps organisations anticipate trends and make proactive decisions. Common analyses include **churn prediction**, **sales forecasting**, and **risk assessment**. For instance, a retail company might use predictive analytics to forecast demand for specific products during the holiday season, allowing them to optimise inventory levels.
- **Prescriptive analytics** goes beyond predictive analytics by recommending actions to optimise outcomes. It uses advanced algorithms and simulations to suggest the best course of action based on predicted scenarios. Common analyses include **optimisation models**, **what-if analysis**, and **resource allocation models**. For example, a logistics company might use prescriptive analytics to determine the most efficient delivery routes based on traffic patterns and weather conditions, minimising costs and improving customer satisfaction.

## Scaler levels of analysis

- **Micro level** refers to the smallest unit of analysis that is an individual within their social setting. At the micro level, also known as the local level, the research often focuses on individuals or small groups in a specific social context. Examples of micro level analysis include various individual-focused approaches: `person`, `partnership`, `family`, `household`, `neighbourhood`, `citizen`
- **Meso level** focuses on populations larger than individuals (micro) but smaller than society as a whole (macro), like communities or organizations. Additionally, meso level analysis can aim to uncover connections between micro and macro levels. This is sometimes termed mid-range, particularly in sociology. Examples of meso level units of analysis include communities and organisations: `clan`, `tribe`, `community`, `village`, `town`, `city`
- **Macro level** examine the results of interactions, like large-scale economic or resource transfers across populations. This is also known as the global level. Examples of macro level units of analysis encompass various large-scale phenomena: `society`, `nation`, `international`, `global`, `civilisation`

# Product analytics

Product analytics is the process of collecting and analysing data related to a product's performance, user behaviour and overall impact. It helps organisations understand how users interact with their products, identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and product success. Product analytics can involve various metrics, such as user engagement, conversion rates, retention rates and feature usage.

Rohrer (2022) suggests that the choice of research method should be based on what users say or do, the type of research methods employed, and the context in which the research is conducted. This three-dimensional framework helps researchers select the most suitable approach for their specific research goals and user needs.[^1]

: Three-dimensional framework of research

| **What users say or do** | **Research methods** | **Context of use** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Attitudinal              | Qualitative          | Scripted           |
| Behaviour                | Quantitative         | Natural            |

## What users say or do

- **Attitudinal research** is a type of user research that aims to understand users' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and feelings about a product, service or problem. It uses methods like interviews, focus groups, surveys and diary studies to gain insights into users' subjective experiences, preferences and decision-making processes.
- **Behavioural research** focuses on observing and measuring how people actually interact with a product or service in real-world situations. This type of research examines users' actions, interactions and usage patterns. Usability studies, web analytics and click rates are typical methods for analysing user behaviours on websites and digital platforms.

## Research methods

### Qualitative research

#### Categorical data types

- **Text data** includes written or typed words, such as responses to open-ended survey questions, interview transcripts or notes taken during observations. It allows researchers to analyse what people say and explore their opinions, ideas and perceptions in detail.
- **Audio data** involves recording spoken words or sounds. It could be from interviews, focus group discussions or even recordings of people using a product or service. Listening to these recordings helps researchers capture tone, emotions and nuances that are not always evident in written text.
- **Video data** involves capturing moving images and sounds. It could be recordings of interviews, user interactions with products or natural behaviour in real-life settings. Video data provides researchers with rich visual and auditory cues, allowing them to observe body language, facial expressions and gestures that offer valuable insights into users' experiences.
- **Visual data** includes pictures, photographs, drawings or any other visual representation. It can be used to capture people's surroundings, their creations or even their own sketches or diagrams. Visual data complements text and audio, providing additional context and understanding of the participants' perspectives.

#### Qualitative analysis

- **Content analysis** is a research method used to systematically analyse and interpret the content of digital interfaces such as websites, apps or other user interfaces. It focuses on understanding how information is presented, organised and communicated to users.
- **Discourse analysis** involves studying how language and communication are used in user interfaces, such as websites, apps or digital platforms. It aims to understand the underlying meanings, cultural influences and power dynamics that emerge from the language and content presented to users.
- **Thematic analysis** is used to identify and analyse themes or patterns within user data such as interviews, surveys or feedback. It involves systematically organising and categorising the data to understand common topics or issues users mention.
- **Narrative analysis** involves studying the stories and experiences that users share about a product or service. By understanding these narratives, researchers can discover users' needs and emotions, helping designers create more user-friendly and empathetic designs. It's about listening to users' stories to improve the overall user experience.
- **Sentiment analysis** is like a computer playing detective to find out how people feel about something. It reads words in comments or reviews and tells us if people are happy, sad, or just okay about it. So, if lots of people say a movie is incredible, the computer tells us that most people really like it. It's a quick way to know what lots of people think without reading every single comment ourselves.
- **Text analysis** is a technique that uses algorithms to extract meaningful information from large volumes of text. It can identify patterns, themes, or sentiments, and is often used in fields like market research, customer service, and social media monitoring. The goal is to turn unstructured data into actionable insights.

#### Common qualitative methods

- **User interviews** are a qualitative research method where the researcher engages individual participants in one-on-one conversations to explore a specific topic of interest. These interviews provide valuable insights into the users' perspectives, preferences and experiences, enabling researchers to gather rich and in-depth information about the subject matter. It's important to note that user interviews are typically conducted without involving any product or service, focusing solely on understanding the participants' thoughts and feedback.
- **Concept testing** presents early-stage ideas to potential users for initial feedback. This helps identify the concept's strengths and weaknesses, aiding in decision-making about its future. The ultimate goal is to minimise risk and allocate resources wisely. This is achieved by determining whether the concept should proceed as is, be modified or be abandoned altogether based on the feedback received.
- **Ethnographic studies** involve researchers observing the actions of one or more participants to understand their behaviour. These studies can be done openly, participants are informed, or secretly, participants are unaware. Ethnographic studies aim to capture how participants naturally use products or services, offering valuable insights into their real-life experiences and behaviours.
- **Diary studies** are used to gather qualitative data over time about user behaviours, activities and experiences. In these studies, participants self-report data longitudinally, covering a period from a few days to a month or more. Diary studies capture users' natural use of products or services, providing valuable insights into their ongoing experiences and interactions.
- **Card sorting** is a research method where consumers organise data into logical categories. Users receive labelled cards and sort them into the categories they find appropriate. These categories can be user-defined or defined by researchers, known as open or closed card sorting. It's important to note that card sorting does not involve using any product. Its main purpose is to understand how users naturally organise information.
- **Tree testing** is a usability technique that assesses how easily users can find topics in a website's hierarchy. It uses a simplified text version of the site structure to isolate and evaluate the organisation. Tree testing, also known as reverse card sorting or card-based classification, offers insights into users' navigation abilities. Unlike traditional usability testing, it focuses solely on the website's structure, without considering design elements or navigational aids.
- **Qualitative usability testing** evaluates products or services by testing them with the target user group. Users perform tasks in a natural environment while researchers observe and identify usability issues. The studies can be conducted in a lab, remotely or without a researcher's presence, unmoderated. The main goal is understanding users' experiences and interactions with the product or service.
- **Qualitative benchmarking** involves a comparative evaluation of processes, practices, or strategies, rather than numerical indicators. For instance, you could assess how your customer service model stacks up against a competitor's, without relying on numerical data. This method offers nuanced insights into organisational culture, best practices, and other less tangible aspects that contribute to performance.
- **Qualitative competitor analysis** focuses on evaluating the non-numerical aspects of your competitors' operations and strategies. This can include an examination of their brand reputation, customer service quality, user experience, and organisational culture. You might delve into customer reviews to gauge satisfaction levels, study their marketing campaigns for messaging and positioning, or even assess the usability of their website or app. The goal is to gain nuanced insights into the factors contributing to their success or shortcomings, which can help you identify opportunities and threats in your own strategy.

### Quantitative research

#### Statistical data types

- Categorical data
    - **Nominal scale** consists of categories or labels with no inherent order or hierarchy. Examples include colours, genders and types of fruits. Each category is distinct and cannot be ranked.
    - **Ordinal scale** also consists of categories, but they have a specific order or rank. However, the differences between categories are not uniform. Examples are severity of illness (e.g. mild, moderate or severe), ratings (e.g. strongly agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree) and education level (e.g. secondary school diploma, bachelor's degree or doctorates).
    - Nominal and ordinal data are inherently **discrete variables** that consist of whole numbers or counts with distinct and separate values. Examples include the number of books owned, the number of people in a group or the number of items sold.
- Numerical data
    - **Interval scale** has numeric values with equal intervals between them. However, there is no true zero point, meaning zero does not indicate an absence of the attribute. Example are temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, IQ scores, dates on the calendar, strings on a violin and levels in a building.
    - **Ratio scale** is similar to interval data but has a true zero point, representing an absence of the attribute. Ratios between values are meaningful. Examples include height, age, volume of liquid and number of children.
    - Interval and ratio data are considered **continuous variables** that can take on any value within a range and is not limited to whole numbers. Examples include temperature measured in decimals, time and distance.
- Types of variables
    - **Independent, predictor, or explanatory variables** , aka **feature** in machine learning, are the variables that researchers manipulate or control in an experiment. It is the cause or predictor variable that influences the dependent variable. For example, in a study examining the effect of sleep on memory, sleep is the independent variable.
    - **Dependent, outcome, or response variables** ,aka **target variable** in machine learning, are the variables that researchers measure or observe to determine the effect of the independent variable. It is the outcome or response variable that is influenced by the independent variable. In the sleep and memory study, memory performance is the dependent variable.
    - **Confounding variables** are additional variables that may influence the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. They can lead to incorrect conclusions if not accounted for in the study design or analysis. For example, in the sleep and memory study, factors like stress, diet or exercise could confound the relationship between sleep and memory performance.
    - **Mediating variables** are variables that explain the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. They help clarify the underlying mechanism or process by which the independent variable affects the dependent variable. In the sleep and memory study, factors like attention or concentration could mediate the relationship between sleep and memory performance.
    - **Moderating variables** are variables that influence the strength or direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. They help identify when or under what conditions the relationship is more or less pronounced. In the sleep and memory study, factors like age or cognitive ability could moderate the relationship between sleep and memory performance.

#### Statistical analysis

- **Descriptive statistics** involves summarising and describing data to gain insights into its central tendency, variability and distribution. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation and percentiles. Descriptive statistics help researchers understand data patterns and draw preliminary conclusions, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.
    - **Table** is a widely used format for presenting descriptive statistics. It effectively summarises and analyses data, providing valuable insights into the central tendency, variability and distribution of a dataset. The standard format includes various measures that aid in comprehending the data.
    - **Graphs** are pictures that make data easier to understand. **Histograms** show how many values fall into different ranges, such as the number of kids at different heights. **Bar charts** compare categories, like ice cream sales in different cities. **Pie charts** show parts of a whole, like how much pizza each person ate. **Line charts** show changes over time, such as temperature during a week. **Box plots** compare groups and show how spread out the data is, like test scores in different classes. **Scatter plots** show connections between two things, like height and weight. **Heat maps** use colours to show patterns in lots of data, like which cities a country gets the most visitors. **Scatter plot matrices** let you see many relationships at once, such as comparing size, colour, and sweetness of fruits.
    - **Sequences sunburst** is a visual representation used to show a sequence of actions or steps, often in a hierarchical structure. Imagine a circular chart divided into layers of rings. The innermost ring represents the starting point, and each outer ring shows a subsequent step or action. This format is useful for visualising complex processes or paths in an engaging way.
- **Inferential statistics** goes beyond describing data and allows researchers to draw conclusions and predictions about larger populations based on a sample. Key concepts include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, statistical significance and proper sampling methods. It is widely used in scientific research and various fields to make informed decisions and predictions with limited data.
    - **Chi-squared test** is a statistical method used to examine the association between two categorical variables. It helps researchers determine if the observed data distribution differs significantly from the expected distribution, assuming no relationship between the variables. By analysing data in a contingency table, the test provides a p-value, indicating the significance level. A low p-value suggests a meaningful association between the variables. The chi-squared test is widely used in social sciences, market research and medical studies to analyse categorical data and draw meaningful conclusions.
    - **T-test** is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if there is a significant difference between them. It is commonly used when analysing numerical data from two independent groups. By calculating a *t*-value and comparing it to a critical value or *p*-value, researchers can assess the statistical significance of the difference in means. The *t*-test is a fundamental tool for making informed decisions and drawing conclusions in various research scenarios.
    - **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of multiple groups simultaneously. It helps identify significant differences in user experience across various design variations or user groups. Using ANOVA, researchers can pinpoint impactful design elements or user segments, enabling data-driven decisions for an improved UX design process.
    - **Correlation analysis** measures how two variables are related. The correlation coefficient *r* ranges from -1 to +1, indicating whether they increase or decrease together. It's helpful in finding patterns and associations between variables in different fields, but remember that correlation doesn't prove causation. More investigation is required to establish causation.
    - **Regression analysis** estimates relationships between a dependent variable and independent variables. It finds the best-fitting line or hyperplane using mathematical criteria like ordinary least squares. This helps predict the dependent variable's value when independent variables have specific values. Regression serves two purposes: prediction and forecasting, like machine learning, and inferring causal relationships. Researchers must justify using regression for prediction or causality, especially with observational data.
     - **Confidence interval** is a range of estimated values for an unknown parameter. The typical confidence level is 95%, but other levels like 90% or 99% are used. The confidence level indicates the proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter value. The width of the confidence interval is influenced by sample size, variability and confidence level. A larger sample size narrows the interval, while more variability or a higher confidence level widens it.
     - **Prospective and retrospective power analysis** help researchers determine the necessary sample size for a study or evaluate the power of an existing study. Prospective power analysis estimates the required sample size to detect a specific effect size with a desired level of statistical power before conducting the study. Retrospective power analysis assesses the statistical power of a completed study based on its sample size, effect size and significance level. Both types of power analysis are essential for ensuring that studies are adequately powered to detect meaningful effects and draw reliable conclusions.

#### Common quantitative methods
- **Surveys** are versatile research tools that can be both qualitative and quantitative, depending on the question format used. They are cost-effective and enable reaching a large group of people simultaneously. Surveys can be designed with scripted questions for standardised responses or open-ended questions to capture natural use and diverse opinions.
- **MaxDiff** (Maximum Difference Scaling) is a survey technique used in market research and psychology to understand people's preferences among a set of items. Respondents are asked to choose the most preferred and least preferred items, allowing researchers to determine the relative importance of each item. MaxDiff is valuable for understanding consumer preferences, product features or brand perception. It provides essential insights for decision-making and product development based on relative ranking and comparison.
- **A/B testing** is a method that compares two versions of a product by presenting them to users to determine which one performs better or is preferred more. This technique allows researchers to assess the impact of different variables or design choices. A/B testing can be conducted with scripted conditions for standardised comparisons or in a natural use environment to understand user preferences in real-world settings.
- **Web Analytics** is the process of measuring, collecting, analysing and reporting web data to understand and optimise web usage. It goes beyond just measuring web traffic and can be used for business and market research, as well as evaluating and improving website effectiveness. This valuable tool helps researchers gain insights into user behaviour and preferences in real-world settings.
- **Eye tracking** is a method used to measure where people look, how long they focus on something and more. It provides a view of what captures users' visual attention, whether it's a product, website, or any other visual stimulus. Eye tracking can be done in controlled, scripted conditions for specific comparisons or in natural use environments to understand users' visual behaviour and preferences in real-world settings.
- **Cohort analysis** is the practice of tracking a select group of users, referred to as a cohort, who have joined a product or service within a specific time frame. The goal is to monitor their engagement levels over various periods to assess their continued interaction and loyalty to the product. This analytical approach yields crucial insights into user retention, helping to pinpoint areas for potential improvement.
- **Funnel analysis** is like watching how many people go through each step in a process, such as shopping online. Imagine a funnel: lots of people enter at the top by visiting a website, but only a few make it to the bottom by actually buying something. By looking at each step, companies can see where people are leaving and try to make things better so more reach the end and make a purchase.
- **Path analysis** is a technique used to visualise and examine the sequential steps a user takes when interacting with a product, such as an app or website, from an entry point to an outcome. It helps identify common user flows, unexpected detours, and critical drop-off points in the user journey to inform experience optimisation and product development.
- **Driver analysis** is a method used to identify and assess the variables that have the most significant impact on a key outcome, such as customer satisfaction or sales performance. By analysing the relationships between various factors and the target metric, businesses can focus on the most influential variables to optimise results. However, these data can often be too interrelated, making statistical analysis tricky. In such cases, a qualitative approach to understanding customer views is recommended.
- **Trajectory analysis** is a method used to track and analyse the paths or sequences taken by subjects over a period of time. Often employed in fields like social science, economics, and healthcare, it helps to identify patterns, trends, and deviations in the course of a subject's behaviour or condition. By mapping these paths, researchers or businesses can gain valuable insights into likely future outcomes or make informed decisions on intervention strategies.
- **Factorial analysis** checks how two or more independent factors affect one dependent variable at the same time, including how those things work together.
- **Factor analysis** simplifies complex data by finding hidden groups or themes (factors) that explain why many different variables are related to each other.
- **Post-hoc analysis** is an extra tests we run after our main statistical test like ANOVA shows a significant result. It helps you figure out exactly where the differences lie, especially when comparing many groups.
- **Quantitative usability testing** is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal is to gather direct input on how real users interact with the system. It involves recording quantitative measures like system usability score or user experience questionnaire, as a post-task assessment. Usability testing can be conducted with scripted conditions to ensure standardised comparisons and observations.
- **Quantitative benchmarking** entails the systematic use of numerical metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and customer retention rates for comparative analysis. By focusing on these measurable data points, you can objectively assess your performance against industry standards or competitors. This approach provides a clear, numerical basis for identifying strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Quantitative competitor analysis** involves the use of numerical data to assess the performance and strategies of your competitors. This can include metrics like market share, revenue, profit margins, and customer retention rates. The aim is to use these measurable figures to compare your standing against competitors in various key areas objectively. Whether it's pricing strategies or advertising spending, quantitative analysis offers a factual basis to identify your competitive advantages and areas requiring improvement.
- **HEART framework** is a user experience measurement model developed by Rodden and colleagues (2010) from Google.[^2] It helps assess the success of a product or service using user-centric metrics. It's widely used in user research to evaluate user satisfaction, measure the impact of design changes, and make informed decisions.
    - **Happiness** measures user satisfaction and happiness with the product or service. It aims to understand how well the user's emotional needs are met and how positively they perceive the overall experience. Common metrics used for assessing happiness include user satisfaction surveys and customer feedback.
    - **Engagement** gauges how involved and interested users are with the product or service. It helps evaluate if users find the content or feature compelling enough to keep them engaged. Metrics such as time spent on the product, number of visits and user interactions can be used to measure engagement.
    - **Adoption** metrics assess how well users adopt and use the product or service. It provides insights into the initial onboarding experience and the number of users successfully integrating the product into their routine. Metrics like sign-ups, account creations or downloads are commonly used to evaluate adoption.
    - **Retention** focuses on user loyalty and the ability to retain users over time. It measures the rate at which users return to the product or service for repeated interactions. Retention is critical for long-term success and is often measured using metrics like churn rate and user retention over a specific period.
    - **Task success** evaluates how effectively users can accomplish specific tasks or goals within the product or service. This element helps identify usability issues and areas for improvement. Metrics like task completion rates and time to complete tasks are commonly used to assess task success.

#### Metrics: Performance indicators

- Goals-signals-metrics process, part of the HEART framework, is designed to enhance user research. It comprises setting long-term goals, identifying success signals and tracking relevant metrics. By adopting this process, product teams can effectively assess and improve the user experience of their products.
    - **Goals** can be outcomes or outputs. Outcomes are specific and help teams focus on achieving clear targets, while outputs lack clarity and may not define success well. By prioritising clear outcomes, businesses can improve strategy effectiveness and achieve growth more effectively. Setting the right goals is crucial for a company's success.
    - **Signals** are leading indicators or conditions that help teams understand if they are on track to achieve their goals. For example, an increased product rating signifies improved user satisfaction. Metrics, like signals, provide valuable insights, but they don't have to be quantitative.
    - **Metrics** are quantitative data used to measure various aspects of a product's performance. User experience metrics, like feature adoption rate and task completion time, assess user experience. Financial metrics, such as customer acquisition costs, reveal user profitability. Choose relevant metrics aligned with your goals and track user actions for accurate measurement.
- User experience metrics
    - What happens during user experiences
        - **Descriptive metrics** give detailed information about how users behave and how well a system performs. For example, waiting time shows how long users wait for a response or service. Average time spent indicates the typical duration users stay on a website or perform actions. Website errors measure how often users encounter issues while navigating. Website visits count how many times users access the site, and usage metrics track how users interact with the product. Page visits show how many pages users view on the site. These metrics provide straightforward data without interpretation, helping us understand user actions and system usage clearly.
    - What user feels about their experience
        - **Perceptive metrics** measure how customers think and feel about their experiences. Factors like messages or music during a wait can influence how they perceive the waiting time. Metrics such as customer satisfaction and system usability scale gather subjective feedback to understand the overall customer experience and loyalty. By capturing these perceptions, businesses can identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall user experience.
    - What user does as a result of their experience
        - **Outcome metrics** are measurements that evaluate how users behave after their experience with a product or service such as sales revenue, reduction in customer complains or return on investment. They help understand how users interact with the interface, achieve their goals efficiently and effectively and take actions like making purchases or becoming loyal customers.
- Business metrics
    - **Website traffic** is the number of people who visit a website. It's like a digital footfall, showing how popular or busy a website is. High traffic usually means more potential customers and better chances for sales or engagement. This metric is often tracked to gauge a website's success and to make improvements.
    - **Sales revenue** is the total amount of money a company earns from selling its products or services. It's like the score in a game, showing how well the business is doing in terms of sales. This number is often the starting point for measuring a company's success and is usually reported over a specific period, like a month or a year.
    - **Profit margin** is the percentage of money left over after a company pays all its costs. It's calculated by dividing the profit by the sales revenue and then multiplying by 100. So if a company earns £100 but spends £80, the profit margin would be 20%. This metric gives a quick snapshot of how efficiently a business is operating; a higher margin usually means the company is doing well.
    - **Employee engagement** measures how involved and enthusiastic employees are about their work and the company they work for. A high level of engagement suggests that employees are not just turning up for a pay check but are emotionally invested in the company's success. This often leads to better performance and can be a sign of a healthy work environment. Companies typically gauge this through surveys, feedback, and observing work habits.
    - **Inventory levels** refers to the amount of goods or materials a company has in stock at a given time. This is crucial for businesses that sell physical products. Too much inventory can be costly to store, while too little can result in missed sales opportunities. Keeping inventory levels balanced is key to running a business efficiently.
- Product metrics
    - Adoption metrics help us understand how many new people start using something and how quickly they find it useful.
        - **Conversion rate** measures the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as signing up for a service or making a purchase. It helps businesses understand how effectively they are turning visitors into customers and can indicate the success of marketing efforts or user experience design.
        - **Trial-to-paid conversion rate** tracks the percentage of users who convert from a free trial to a paid subscription or purchase. This metric helps businesses understand how effectively they are converting trial users into paying customers and can indicate the success of the trial experience.
        - **Time to first value** tracks the time it takes for a new user to experience the first meaningful benefit or value from using a product or service. This metric is crucial for understanding how quickly users can see the advantages of the product, which can impact their overall satisfaction and likelihood of continued use.
        - **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)** measures the average cost of acquiring a new customer. This metric helps businesses understand the efficiency of their marketing and sales efforts and can inform strategies for customer acquisition and retention. The formula to calculate CAC is: CAC = (total marketing and sales expenses) / (number of new customers acquired) e.g. if a company spends £10,000 on marketing and sales in a month and acquires 100 new customers, the CAC would be £10,000 / 100 = £100.
    - Engagement metrics tell us how much people enjoy using something and how often they spend time with it.
        - **Active users** measures the number of unique users who engage with a product or service over a specific period. This metric helps businesses understand their user base and can indicate overall product adoption and engagement.
        - **Daily active users (DAU)** counts the number of unique users who engage with a product or service on a daily basis. This metric helps businesses understand how frequently users interact with their product and can indicate user engagement and satisfaction.
        - **Monthly active users (MAU)** counts the number of unique users who engage with a product or service on a monthly basis. This metric provides insights into user retention and long-term engagement with the product.
        - **Stickiness** is a measure of how often users return to a product or service after their initial visit. It is typically calculated by dividing the number of daily active users (DAU) by the number of monthly active users (MAU). A higher stickiness ratio indicates that users find the product valuable and are more likely to return.
        - **Session duration** measures the length of time a user spends interacting with a product or service during a single session. This metric helps businesses understand how engaging their product is and can indicate user satisfaction and interest.
        - **Pages per session** tracks the average number of pages a user visits during a single session. This metric provides insights into user engagement and the effectiveness of the product's content or features in encouraging exploration.
        - **Bounce rate** measures the percentage of users who leave a product or service after viewing only one page or taking no further action. A high bounce rate can indicate issues with user experience, content relevance or overall satisfaction.
        - **Feature usage** tracks how often specific features or functionalities of a product or service are used by users. This metric helps businesses understand which features are most valuable to users and can inform decisions about product development and prioritisation.
        - **Response time** measures the time it takes for a product or service to respond to user actions or requests. This metric is critical for user experience, as fast response times contribute to a positive interaction and increased satisfaction.
        - **Load time** measures how quickly a product or service responds to user actions or requests. This metric is crucial for user experience, as slow load times can lead to frustration and decreased satisfaction.
        - **Error rate** tracks the frequency of errors or issues encountered by users while interacting with a product or service. This metric helps businesses identify and address technical problems that may impact user experience and satisfaction.
    - Retention metrics reveal how well a company keeps people interested so they don't leave.
        - **Churn rate** measures the percentage of users who stop using a product or service over a specific period. It helps businesses understand how well they are retaining their customers and can indicate issues with user satisfaction or product value.
        - **Cohort retention rate** tracks the percentage of users from a specific group (cohort) who continue to use a product or service over time. This metric helps businesses understand how well they are retaining different segments of their customer base and can indicate the effectiveness of retention strategies.
        - **Repeat purchase rate** measures the percentage of customers who make multiple purchases from a business over a specific period. This metric helps businesses understand customer loyalty and satisfaction, as repeat customers are often more valuable than one-time buyers.
        - **Referral rate** measures the percentage of new customers who are acquired through referrals from existing customers. This metric helps businesses understand the effectiveness of their referral programs and the level of customer satisfaction, as satisfied customers are more likely to recommend a product or service to others.
        - **Customer retention cost (CRC)** measures the average cost of retaining an existing customer. This metric helps businesses understand the efficiency of their retention efforts and can inform strategies for customer loyalty and satisfaction. The formula to calculate CRC is: CRC = (total retention expenses) / (number of retained customers) e.g. if a company spends £8,000 on retention efforts in a month and retains 200 customers, the CRC would be £8,000 / 200 = £40.
        - **Customer lifetime value** estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship. This metric helps businesses understand the long-term value of their customers and informs strategies for customer acquisition and retention. The formula to calculate CLV is: CLV = (average purchase value) x (purchase frequency) x (customer lifespan) e.g. if a customer spends £50 per purchase, makes 4 purchases a year, and remains a customer for 5 years, their CLV would be £50 x 4 x 5 = £1,000.
    - Monetisation metrics explain how a company makes money. It's about income generation.
        - **Average order value (AOV)** calculates the average amount of money spent by customers per order. It helps businesses understand customer purchasing behaviour and can inform strategies for pricing, marketing and product offerings. The formula to calculate AOV is: AOV = (total revenue) / (number of orders) e.g. if a company has a total revenue of £50,000 from 1,000 orders, the AOV would be £50,000 / 1,000 = £50.
        - **Average revenue per user (ARPU)** calculates the average amount of money generated per user over a specific period. It helps businesses understand the revenue contribution of each user and can inform strategies for pricing, marketing and customer acquisition. The formula to calculate ARPU is: ARPU = (total revenue) / (number of users) e.g. if a company has a total revenue of £100,000 and 2,000 users, the ARPU would be £100,000 / 2,000 = £50.
        - **Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)** measures the predictable and recurring revenue generated by a business on a monthly basis. This metric is particularly important for subscription-based businesses, as it helps them understand their financial stability and growth potential.
        - **Annual recurring revenue (ARR)** measures the predictable and recurring revenue generated by a business on an annual basis. This metric is particularly important for subscription-based businesses, as it helps them understand their long-term financial stability and growth potential.
    - Revenue metrics describe how well a company manages money. It’s about overall money health and efficiency.
        - **Revenue growth rate** tracks the percentage increase in a company's revenue over a specific period. This metric helps businesses understand their financial performance and can indicate the effectiveness of their growth strategies.
        - **Gross margin** calculates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It helps businesses understand their profitability and can inform strategies for pricing, production and cost management. The formula to calculate gross margin is: Gross Margin = [(Revenue - COGS) / Revenue] x 100 e.g. if a company has a revenue of £100,000 and COGS of £60,000, the gross margin would be [(£100,000 - £60,000) / £100,000] x 100 = 40%.
        - **Net profit margin** calculates the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses have been deducted. It helps businesses understand their overall profitability and can inform strategies for cost management and revenue growth. The formula to calculate net profit margin is: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) x 100 e.g. if a company has a net profit of £20,000 and revenue of £100,000, the net profit margin would be (£20,000 / £100,000) x 100 = 20%.
        - **Return on investment (ROI)** measures the profitability of an investment by comparing the net profit to the initial cost of the investment. This metric helps businesses understand the effectiveness of their investments and can inform strategies for resource allocation and decision-making. The formula to calculate ROI is: ROI = [(Net Profit - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost] x 100 e.g. if a company invests £5,000 in a marketing campaign and generates a net profit of £15,000, the ROI would be [(£15,000 - £5,000) / £5,000] x 100 = 200%.

> [!NOTE]
> North Star metric is the most important metric that reflects the core value a product delivers to its customers. It serves as a guiding light for product teams, helping them focus on what truly matters for long-term success. The North Star metric should be closely tied to customer value and business growth, providing a clear direction for decision-making and prioritisation.

> [!WARNING]
> Net Promoter Score (NPS), commonly used as a perception metric in marketing, is no longer recommended for gathering customer insights in behavioural science and user experience due to its fallacious nature. Keiningham and colleagues (2007) argue that there is no empirical evidence supporting the likelihood to recommend question as a better predictor of business growth than other customer loyalty questions such as customer satisfaction and likelihood to purchase again.[^3]

## Context of use

- **Scripted use** of the product is commonly employed in lab-based or usability studies, focusing on testing or examining specific aspects of the product. This approach allows researchers to control and standardise the testing process, ensuring the desired aspects are thoroughly assessed.
- **Natural use** of the product involves testing products in a real-world or near-natural setting with minimal interference from researchers. This method provides highly valid data as users interact with the product in authentic contexts. However, the drawback is that researchers cannot ask clarifying questions to users during the process, potentially limiting the depth of insights obtained.

# Applied research

Applied research focuses on practical problem-solving and finding real-world solutions. Its primary goal is to address specific issues, improve processes or develop new products, and technologies. Unlike pure research, applied research is directly connected to making tangible improvements and positive impacts in various fields. It uses existing theories and knowledge as a foundation to generate actionable results and practical insights. Some common types and approaches of applied research include:

: Types of applied research

| **Generative research** | **Evaluative research** | **Research approaches** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Exploratory             | Formative               | Traditional             |
| Explanatory             | Summative               | Agile                   |

## Generative research

This type of research focused on generating new ideas and insights during the early stages of product development. It aims to explore user needs and behaviours through qualitative methods like interviews and observations. By uncovering user context and pain points, generative research inspires creative and user-centred design solutions, leading to more effective and meaningful products or services.

- **Exploratory research** often qualitative is a preliminary and open-ended investigation that aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of a topic or problem. It uses qualitative methods to generate insights, ideas and hypotheses, rather than testing specific hypotheses or making definitive conclusions. The insights from exploratory research provide a solid foundation for further investigation and decision-making in subsequent research studies.
- **Explanatory research** often quantitative aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables and uncover the reasons behind observed phenomena. It goes beyond exploratory research to establish cause-and-effect relationships and test specific hypotheses. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, explanatory research helps researchers make predictions and draw conclusions about the effects of variables on outcomes. It plays a crucial role in confirming or refuting existing theories and guiding future research and decision-making.

## Evaluative research

This type of research focuses on assessing and judging the effectiveness and impact of existing products, services or interventions, unlike exploratory or explanatory research, which seeks to understand phenomena. Evaluative research aims to make informed decisions and improve designs based on collected data. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, it gathers feedback from users or participants to refine and optimise products or services, measure intervention impact and ensure they meet user needs and expectations. Evaluative research plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making and enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Formative research** often qualitative is conducted in the early stages of a project or program to gather insights and feedback that inform its development and design. It focuses on understanding the target audience's needs and behaviours, using qualitative and quantitative methods like interviews and surveys. By involving users and stakeholders, formative research ensures that the final product or program is well-informed and relevant, leading to more effective solutions and successful outcomes.
- **Summative research** often quantitative evaluates the overall effectiveness and impact of a project, program or intervention at its conclusion. Unlike formative research, which informs the design, summative research measures the extent to which objectives have been achieved. It uses quantitative methods like surveys and assessments to collect data and draw conclusions about the success of the initiative. The insights from summative research are valuable for stakeholders, guiding future improvements and decision-making based on the project's outcomes.

## Research approaches

- **Traditional approach** is the usual way of doing research, following a step-by-step process. It includes planning, data collection, analysis and reporting in a specific order. It has a fixed design and is focused on getting accurate results, but it may take longer because it's less flexible.
- **Agile approach** is a flexible and adaptive approach to research, inspired by agile software development. It breaks down the process into smaller tasks, allowing continuous data gathering and analysis. Researchers can make real-time adjustments based on insights, focusing on high-priority areas. It is valuable in dynamic environments with evolving research questions.

# Empirical research

Empirical research is a systematic investigation that relies on observation, experimentation and data collection to answer specific questions or test hypotheses. It involves gathering evidence through various methods, such as experiments, surveys, interviews and observations, to draw conclusions based on real-world data. Empirical research is essential in fields like social sciences, natural sciences and applied research, as it provides a solid foundation for understanding phenomena and making informed decisions.

## Data collection

Data collection is the process of gathering information to answer research questions or test hypotheses. It involves systematically collecting data from various sources, such as surveys, interviews, experiments or observations. The goal is to obtain accurate and reliable data that can be analysed to draw meaningful conclusions. Data collection methods can be qualitative or quantitative, depending on the nature of the research and the type of data needed.

### Three basic types

- **Sample survey** is like asking a small group of people questions to learn something about a bigger group. Imagine you want to know what ice cream flavour your whole school likes. Instead of asking everyone, that'd take forever, you ask a few kids from different classes. Their answers give you a hint about what the whole school might prefer.
    - Faster, cheaper and easier to analyse
- **Observational study** is like watching and recording things without interfering. You don't control anything. You just track what happens and try to see if there are any patterns. Imagine you're a detective at the zoo, trying to figure out why the zebras love stripes so much. You can't ask them directly, so you do the next best thing. You observe! You watch how they spend their days, what makes them happy, and even how they interact with other animals.
    - Discover secrets, no cheating, useful everywhere
- **Experimental study** is like asking a question of the world, but not just with words, with actions! It's your way of getting proof and understanding something better. Imagine you're trying to figure out which plant grows faster, sunlight or shade. You wouldn't just guess, right? You'd set up two pots, put one in the sun and one in the shade, and watch what happens.
    - Ask a question, make a guess, set up a test, collect data, analyse the result

### Classification of user data

- **Demographic data** is information about your customers, like their age, gender, income, and education. It helps you know who your customers are and what they need. You can use this data to group your customers for marketing. For instance, if you sell anti-wrinkle cream, you might concentrate on age groups that are more likely to buy it. Gathering this data makes your marketing more focused and improves the outcomes.
- **Psychographic data** includes a customer's values, personality traits, opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyle. It goes beyond just demographic information. While demographics appeal to the logical side, psychographic data helps tap into the emotional aspect of buying decisions. Businesses and products don't have emotions, but humans do. Understanding what motivates your customer emotionally, what messaging resonates with them, and what brand attitude connects with them, becomes clearer with psychographic data. It's about making customers feel something to drive their buying decisions.
- **Behavioural data** includes customer actions, like purchases, website visits, or signing up for newsletters. It helps you grasp what your customers want and how they engage with your business. For instance, in the wrinkle cream case, if users of a certain age visit your website, click on product pages, and later sign up for your newsletter, it shows brand awareness and buyer intent. Analysing such data helps optimise touch points in your customer journey. Understanding when and why customers act the way they do enhances your marketing efforts, especially in re-engaging returning customers.
- **Transactional data** is details about a customer's financial activities, like how much they spend, how often they make purchases, the time it takes for them to buy, and how many items they return. This data helps marketers grasp spending habits and trends among customers, which becomes crucial when market conditions change, new technology emerges, or new factors affect buying decisions.

### Direction of investigation

- **Retrospective study** refers to the study looks back at **past data** that has already been collected. It's like analysing old footage to learn something new.
    - **Retrospective cohort study** is a type of longitudinal cohort study that looks back in time to analyse data about a group of people who share a common exposure or characteristic. Researchers examine the health outcomes of this group over a specific period to investigate the potential association between the exposure and the outcome.
- **Prospective study** refers to the study is designed and conducted in the present, with **future data** collected specifically for the research question. It's like filming a new documentary with a specific focus.
    - **Prospective cohort study** is another type of longitudinal cohort study. Unlike its retrospective counterpart, it looks forward in time. Researchers actively recruit a group of people who share a common exposure or characteristic and then follow them over a period to observe their health outcomes.

## Statistical sample

Statistical sample is a subset of a larger population that is selected for analysis in a research study. The sample is used to draw conclusions about the entire population based on the data collected from the sample. The goal is to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, allowing researchers to make generalisations and predictions about the larger group.

### Modes of administration

- **Sourcing** in an experiment refers to the process of finding and selecting participants, materials, or data for the study. For example, researchers might source participants through online advertisements or use specific criteria to select data sets for analysis. Proper sourcing is crucial for ensuring the experiment's validity and reliability.
    - **Email survey** is a questionnaire sent via email to collect data for research or feedback. Participants receive the survey in their inbox, complete it at their convenience, and then submit their responses electronically. It's a cost-effective and quick way to gather information, though response rates can vary.
    - **In-product survey** is a questionnaire that appears within a software application or website, targeting users while they are actively engaged with the product. This method aims to collect real-time feedback or data, providing insights into user behaviour, satisfaction, or specific features. It's a direct way to gauge user experience without requiring participants to leave the product environment.
    - **Panel** in a database context refers to a curated list of respondents maintained by service providers for research purposes. Members of the panel may participate in various studies and can be revisited for data collection over extended periods. This allows for consistent and reliable research findings.
- **Screening** in research refers to the initial process of evaluating potential participants to determine their suitability for a study. Criteria may include age, health status, or specific behaviours. The aim is to ensure that the selected participants fit the study's objectives and requirements, thereby making the results more reliable and applicable.

### Sampling methods

- **Probability sampling** is the process of randomly selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to study, where each member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected into the sample. This smaller group, or sample, is chosen to represent the larger population and help researchers draw conclusions about it. The idea is to study the sample and then make generalisations about the larger group based on the findings.
    - **Simple random sample** is a subset of individuals chosen from a larger population. Each individual is selected randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. This method is like drawing names out of a hat and aims to give every individual an equal chance of being included in the sample. It's a straightforward way to get a snapshot of a larger group. The sample can be heterogeneous, and homogeneity is not considered in this method.\
    ![Simple random sampling](https://github.com/x-square/visual-resources/blob/main/sampling-simple-random.png?raw=true 'Simple random sampling')
    - **Systematic sample** involves arranging every member of a population in a specific order. Then, you randomly select a starting point in the sequence and pick members for your sample at consistent intervals. Same as simple random sampling, the sample can be heterogeneous, and homogeneity is not considered in this method.\
    ![Systematic sampling](https://github.com/x-square/visual-resources/blob/main/sampling-systematic.png?raw=true 'Systematic sampling')
    - **Stratified sample** is where the population is divided into different subgroups, or strata, usually based on a specific characteristic like age or income. Random samples are then taken from each stratum. This method aims to ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the final sample. Strata are homogeneous within but heterogeneous between.\
    ![Stratified sampling](https://github.com/x-square/visual-resources/blob/main/sampling-stratified.png?raw=true 'Stratified sampling')
    - **Cluster sample** is where the population is divided into clusters, often geographically or by some other natural grouping. A random sample of clusters is chosen, and then either all individuals in the selected clusters are surveyed, or a random sample from each selected cluster is surveyed. Clusters are heterogeneous and similar to the entire population. Homogeneity is not required within clusters.\
    ![Cluster sampling](https://github.com/x-square/visual-resources/blob/main/sampling-cluster.png?raw=true 'Cluster sampling')
- **Non-probability sampling** lacks random selection, leading to uneven representation and a higher risk of bias. Every individual in the population is not guaranteed to have an equal chance of being selected. Despite this limitation, they offer cost and time efficiencies for researchers. When resources are limited, this method provides a practical solution, particularly for exploratory studies focused on initial insights rather than making broad conclusions about a population.
    - **Convenience sample** involves selecting easily accessible members of a population. It's called convenience because you gather samples from places convenient to you, like your workplace, a nearby school, or a public park.
    - **Voluntary response sample** includes population members who choose to join a study. Similar to convenience sampling, it's often based on easy access to the population. But here, participants decide to join on their own, rather than being selected by the researcher.
    - **Snowball sample** involves researchers initially recruiting participants for a study and then asking them to invite others to join. This method gradually increases the sample size, similar to how a snowball grows in size as it rolls. It's commonly used when accessing the desired population is challenging.
    - **Purposive sample** involves researchers selecting participants based on the goals of their study. Only individuals who meet the criteria are chosen, while others are excluded.

## Experimental design

- **Randomisation** is a way to put people into different groups in a study so that everyone has an equal chance of being picked. It helps make the study more reliable because it reduces the chance that other factors could affect the results. This is what makes it a true experiment rather than just an observation. While there's a slight risk of the groups being unbalanced, using a large enough number of people can manage this risk. If the people in the study have important differences, you can use a method called 'stratified sampling' to make sure each group is fairly represented. This helps in getting results that can be applied to a larger group of people.
- **Blocking** in research is the practice of organising experimental units into groups, or blocks, that are similar in some way that might affect the result of the experiment. For example, if you're studying the effects of a drug on people of different ages, you might create blocks of participants who are similarly aged. This helps to make the study's findings more accurate by controlling for variables like age.
- **Between-subjects design** is a research approach where each participant is exposed to only one condition or treatment. For instance, in a study comparing two types of painkillers, one group of people would take Painkiller A while another group would take Painkiller B. This design helps to avoid issues like practice effects but may require more participants to ensure accurate results.
- **Within-subjects design** is a research method where the same participants are used in all the different conditions of an experiment. For example, if you're testing two types of exercises for improving fitness, each participant would try both exercises at different times. This approach helps to reduce the number of participants needed and controls for individual differences, but it can be affected by factors like fatigue or learning effects.
- **Blind** **experiment** is a study where the participants don't know certain details about the experiment, such as whether they're receiving a treatment or a placebo. This helps to prevent bias, ensuring the results are more reliable. For example, in a medical trial, a blind experiment would mean that patients don't know if they're taking real medicine or a sugar pill, making their responses more genuine.
- **Double-blind experiment** is one where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the treatment or the placebo. This helps to eliminate both participant and experimenter bias, making the study's results more trustworthy. For example, in a drug trial, a double-blind setup ensures that neither the patient nor the medical staff knows who is receiving the real medication, which makes the findings more reliable.
- **Unblinding** happens when someone in a blind experiment figures out information they're not supposed to know, like whether they got the real treatment or a fake one. This can mess up the results because it adds bias. Sometimes unblinding happens by accident or too early, which isn't ideal. The success of keeping the experiment blind is usually checked by asking people questions to see if they've figured anything out. While it's hard to measure unblinding perfectly, you can still get a good idea of how well the experiment was kept blind.
- **Replication** is the process of repeating a study or experiment to see if the same results are obtained. This helps to confirm the findings are reliable and not just a one-off occurrence. For example, if one research team finds that a certain diet helps in weight loss, another team might replicate the study to ensure the results hold true.

## Statistical inference

- **Correlation** measures the degree of association between two variables, ranging from **positive** that values move together to **negative** that values move in opposite directions to zero that **no relationship**, that is, strength of relationship.
    - In general, the presence of a correlation is not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship.
    - The direction of correlation doesn't inherently reveal which variable is influencing the other. That's where causality comes into play.
- **Association** simply indicates that two variables are related in some way without specifying the strength or direction.
- **Dependence** occurs when one variable **independent** influences another variable **dependent**.
- **Independence** indicates two variables are not statistically related and have no influence on each other.
- **Causality** or **cause-and-effect** is a specific type of statistical relationship where **one variable directly influences another and not the other way round**. Establishing strong evidence for causality requires more than just observing a correlation or association. Researchers typically conduct experiments to control variables and isolate the potential cause.
