`This file covers essential terms for both researchers and non-researchers`

Knowing the terms in user research is important because it allows clear communication, efficient planning and informed decision-making. It helps researchers interpret findings accurately and stay updated with the latest trends. For non-researchers, understanding these terms enables meaningful engagement and contributes to user-centred design, leading to better products and services for users.

User research adopts a common iterative design approach found in user-centred design and design thinking. It can be applied throughout the design cycle, with software projects often beginning at the requirement gathering stage to engage users from the project's outset. A variety of research methods are employed in user research. Rohrer (2022)[^1] offers a helpful three-dimensional framework to determine the appropriate method for specific situations.

: Three-dimensional framework

### What users say or do

-   **Attitudinal** **research** is a type of user research that aims to understand users' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and feelings about a product, service or problem. It uses methods like interviews, focus groups, surveys and diary studies to gain insights into users' subjective experiences, preferences and decision-making processes.
-   **Behavioural** **research** focuses on observing and measuring how people actually interact with a product or service in real-world situations. This type of research examines users' actions, interactions and usage patterns. Usability studies, web analytics and click rates are common methods used to analyse user behaviours on websites and digital platforms.

### Research methods

#### Qualitative

-   Data types
    -   **Text data** includes written or typed words, such as responses to open-ended survey questions, interview transcripts or notes taken during observations. It allows researchers to analyse what people say and explore their opinions, ideas and perceptions in detail.
    -   **Audio data** involves recording spoken words or sounds. It could be from interviews, focus group discussions or even recordings of people using a product or service. Listening to these recordings helps researchers capture tone, emotions and nuances that are not always evident in written text.
    -   **Video data** involves capturing moving images and sounds. It could be recordings of interviews, user interactions with products or natural behaviour in real-life settings. Video data provides researchers with rich visual and auditory cues, allowing them to observe body language, facial expressions and gestures that offer valuable insights into users' experiences.
    -   **Visual data** includes pictures, photographs, drawings or any other visual representation. It can be used to capture people's surroundings, their creations or even their own sketches or diagrams. Visual data complements text and audio, providing additional context and understanding of the participants' perspectives.
-   Data analysis
    -   **Content analysis** is a research method used to systematically analyse and interpret the content of digital interfaces such as websites, apps or other user interfaces. It focuses on understanding how information is presented, organised and communicated to users.
    -   **Discourse analysis** involves studying how language and communication are used in user interfaces, such as websites, apps or digital platforms. It aims to understand the underlying meanings, cultural influences and power dynamics that emerge from the language and content presented to users.
    -   **Thematic analysis** is used to identify and analyse themes or patterns within user data such as interviews, surveys or feedback. It involves systematically organising and categorising the data to understand common topics or issues that users mention.
    -   **Narrative analysis** involves studying the stories and experiences that users share about a product or service. By understanding these narratives, researchers can discover users' needs and emotions, helping designers create more user-friendly and empathetic designs. It's about listening to users' stories to improve the overall user experience.

#### Quantitative

-   Categorical data
    -   **Nominal data** consists of categories or labels with no inherent order or hierarchy. Examples include colours, genders or types of fruits. Each category is distinct and cannot be ranked.
    -   **Ordinal data** also consists of categories, but they have a specific order or rank. However, the differences between categories are not uniform. An example is ranking preferences (e.g. first, second, third) or ratings (e.g. strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree)
-   Numerical data
    -   **Interval data** has numeric values with equal intervals between them. However, there is no true zero point, meaning zero does not indicate an absence of the attribute. An example is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
    -   **Ratio data** is similar to interval data but has a true zero point, which represents an absence of the attribute. Ratios between values are meaningful. Examples include height, weight and age.
-   Values
    -   **Discrete variable** consists of whole numbers or counts with distinct and separate values. Examples include the number of books owned, the number of people in a group or the number of items sold.
    -   **Continuous variable** can take on any value within a range and is not limited to whole numbers. Examples include temperature measured in decimals, time and distance.
-   Statistical analysis
    -   **Descriptive statistics** involves summarising and describing data to gain insights into its central tendency, variability and distribution. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation and percentiles. Descriptive statistics help researchers understand data patterns and draw preliminary conclusions, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.
    -   **Inferential statistics** goes beyond describing data and allows researchers to draw conclusions and predictions about larger populations based on a sample. Key concepts include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, statistical significance and proper sampling methods. It is widely used in scientific research and various fields to make informed decisions and predictions with limited data.
        -   **Chi-squared test** is a statistical method used to examine the association between two categorical variables. It helps researchers determine if the observed distribution of data differs significantly from the expected distribution, assuming no relationship between the variables. By analysing data in a contingency table, the test provides a p-value, indicating the level of significance. A low p-value suggests a meaningful association between the variables. The chi-squared test is widely used in social sciences, market research and medical studies to analyse categorical data and draw meaningful conclusions.
        -   ***t*****-test** is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups and determine if there is a significant difference between them. It is commonly used when analysing numerical data from two independent groups. By calculating a *t*-value and comparing it to a critical value or *p*-value, researchers can assess the statistical significance of the difference in means. The *t*-test is a fundamental tool for making informed decisions and drawing conclusions in various research scenarios.

### Context of use

-   **Scripted use** of the product is commonly employed in lab-based or usability studies, focusing on testing or examining specific aspects of the product. This approach allows researchers to control and standardise the testing process, ensuring that the desired aspects are thoroughly assessed.
-   **Natural use** of the product involves testing products in a real-world or near-natural setting with minimal interference from researchers. This method provides highly valid data as users interact with the product in authentic contexts. However, the drawback is that researchers cannot ask clarifying questions to users during the process, potentially limiting the depth of insights obtained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applied research focuses on practical problem-solving and finding real-world solutions. Its primary goal is to address specific issues, improve processes or develop new products and technologies. Unlike pure research, applied research is directly connected to making tangible improvements and positive impacts in various fields. It uses existing theories and knowledge as a foundation to generate actionable results and practical insights.

User research as part of applied research can be classified into various types, each serving specific purposes and providing unique insights. Some common types of user research include:

| Generative research | Evaluative research | Research approaches |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Exploratory         | Formative           | Traditional         |
| Explanatory         | Summative           | Agile               |

: Types of user research

### Generative research

This type of research focused on generating new ideas and insights during the early stages of product development. It aims to explore user needs and behaviours through qualitative methods like interviews and observations. By uncovering user context and pain points, generative research inspires creative and user-centred design solutions, leading to more effective and meaningful products or services.

-   **Exploratory research** is a preliminary and open-ended investigation that aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of a topic or problem. It uses qualitative methods to generate insights, ideas and hypotheses, rather than testing specific hypotheses or making definitive conclusions. The insights from exploratory research provide a solid foundation for further investigation and decision-making in subsequent research studies.
-   **Explanatory research** aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables and uncover the reasons behind observed phenomena. It goes beyond exploratory research to establish cause-and-effect relationships and test specific hypotheses. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, explanatory research helps researchers make predictions and draw conclusions about the effects of variables on outcomes. It plays a crucial role in confirming or refuting existing theories and guiding future research and decision-making.

### Evaluative research

This type of research focuses on assessing and judging the effectiveness and impact of existing products, services, or interventions. Unlike exploratory or explanatory research, which seeks to understand phenomena. Evaluative research aims to make informed decisions and improve designs based on collected data. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, it gathers feedback from users or participants to refine and optimise products or services, measure intervention impact and ensure they meet user needs and expectations. Evaluative research plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making and enhancing the overall user experience.

-   **Formative research** is conducted in the early stages of a project or program to gather insights and feedback that inform its development and design. It focuses on understanding the target audience's needs and behaviours, using qualitative and quantitative methods like interviews and surveys. By involving users and stakeholders, formative research ensures that the final product or program is well-informed and relevant, leading to more effective solutions and successful outcomes.
-   **Summative research** evaluates the overall effectiveness and impact of a project, program or intervention at its conclusion. Unlike formative research, which informs the design, summative research measures the extent to which objectives have been achieved. It uses quantitative methods like surveys and assessments to collect data and draw conclusions about the success of the initiative. The insights from summative research are valuable for stakeholders, guiding future improvements and decision-making based on the project's outcomes.

### Research approaches

-   **Traditional approach** is the usual way of doing research, following a step-by-step process. It includes planning, data collection, analysis, and reporting in a specific order. It has a fixed design and is focused on getting accurate results, but it may take longer because it's less flexible.
-   **Agile** **approach** is a flexible and adaptive approach to research, inspired by agile software development. It breaks down the process into smaller tasks, allowing continuous data gathering and analysis. Researchers can make real-time adjustments based on insights, focusing on high-priority areas. It is valuable in dynamic environments with evolving research questions.
