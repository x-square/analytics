`This document covers essential user research terms for both researchers and non-researchers`

Knowing the terms in user research is important because it allows clear communication, efficient planning and informed decision-making. It helps researchers interpret findings accurately and stay updated with the latest trends. For non-researchers, understanding these terms enables meaningful engagement and contributes to user-centred design, leading to better products and services for users.

User research adopts a common iterative design approach found in user-centred design and design thinking. It can be applied throughout the design cycle, with software projects often beginning at the requirement-gathering stage to engage users from the project's outset. A variety of research methods are employed in user research. Rohrer (2022)[^1] offers a helpful three-dimensional framework to determine the appropriate method for specific situations.

: Three-dimensional framework

### What users say or do

-   **Attitudinal research** is a type of user research that aims to understand users' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and feelings about a product, service or problem. It uses methods like interviews, focus groups, surveys and diary studies to gain insights into users' subjective experiences, preferences and decision-making processes.
-   **Behavioural research** focuses on observing and measuring how people actually interact with a product or service in real-world situations. This type of research examines users' actions, interactions and usage patterns. Usability studies, web analytics and click rates are common methods for analysing user behaviours on websites and digital platforms.

### Research methods

#### Qualitative research

-   Data types
    -   **Text data** includes written or typed words, such as responses to open-ended survey questions, interview transcripts or notes taken during observations. It allows researchers to analyse what people say and explore their opinions, ideas and perceptions in detail.
    -   **Audio data** involves recording spoken words or sounds. It could be from interviews, focus group discussions or even recordings of people using a product or service. Listening to these recordings helps researchers capture tone, emotions and nuances that are not always evident in written text.
    -   **Video data** involves capturing moving images and sounds. It could be recordings of interviews, user interactions with products or natural behaviour in real-life settings. Video data provides researchers with rich visual and auditory cues, allowing them to observe body language, facial expressions and gestures that offer valuable insights into users' experiences.
    -   **Visual data** includes pictures, photographs, drawings or any other visual representation. It can be used to capture people's surroundings, their creations or even their own sketches or diagrams. Visual data complements text and audio, providing additional context and understanding of the participants' perspectives.
-   Data analysis
    -   **Content analysis** is a research method used to systematically analyse and interpret the content of digital interfaces such as websites, apps or other user interfaces. It focuses on understanding how information is presented, organised and communicated to users.
    -   **Discourse analysis** involves studying how language and communication are used in user interfaces, such as websites, apps or digital platforms. It aims to understand the underlying meanings, cultural influences and power dynamics that emerge from the language and content presented to users.
    -   **Thematic analysis** is used to identify and analyse themes or patterns within user data such as interviews, surveys or feedback. It involves systematically organising and categorising the data to understand common topics or issues users mention.
    -   **Narrative analysis** involves studying the stories and experiences that users share about a product or service. By understanding these narratives, researchers can discover users' needs and emotions, helping designers create more user-friendly and empathetic designs. It's about listening to users' stories to improve the overall user experience.
-   Common qualitative methods
    -   **User interviews** are a qualitative research method where the researcher engages individual participants in one-on-one conversations to explore a specific topic of interest. These interviews provide valuable insights into the users' perspectives, preferences and experiences, enabling researchers to gather rich and in-depth information about the subject matter. It's important to note that user interviews are typically conducted without involving any product or service, focusing solely on understanding the participants' thoughts and feedback.
    -   **Ethnographic studies** involve researchers observing the actions of one or more participants to understand their behaviour. These studies can be done openly, participants are informed, or secretly, participants are unaware. Ethnographic studies aim to capture how participants naturally use products or services, offering valuable insights into their real-life experiences and behaviours.
    -   **Diary studies** are used to gather qualitative data over time about user behaviours, activities and experiences. In these studies, participants self-report data longitudinally, covering a period from a few days to a month or more. Diary studies capture users' natural use of products or services, providing valuable insights into their ongoing experiences and interactions.
    -   **Card sorting** is a research method where consumers organise data into logical categories. Users receive labelled cards and sort them into the categories they find appropriate. These categories can be user-defined or defined by researchers, known as open or closed card sorting. It's important to note that card sorting does not involve using any product. Its main purpose is to understand how users naturally organise information.
    -   **Tree testing** is a usability technique that assesses how easily users can find topics in a website's hierarchy. It uses a simplified text version of the site structure to isolate and evaluate the organisation. Tree testing, also known as reverse card sorting or card-based classification, offers insights into users' navigation abilities. Unlike traditional usability testing, it focuses solely on the website's structure, without considering design elements or navigational aids.
    -   **Qualitative usability testing** evaluates products or services by testing them with the target user group. Users perform tasks in a natural environment while researchers observe and identify usability issues. The studies can be conducted in a lab, remotely or without a researcher's presence, unmoderated. The main goal is understanding users' experiences and interactions with the product or service.

#### Quantitative research

-   Categorical data
    -   **Nominal data** consists of categories or labels with no inherent order or hierarchy. Examples include colours, genders or types of fruits. Each category is distinct and cannot be ranked.
    -   **Ordinal data** also consists of categories, but they have a specific order or rank. However, the differences between categories are not uniform. An example is ranking preferences (e.g. first, second, third) or ratings (e.g. strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree)
-   Numerical data
    -   **Interval data** has numeric values with equal intervals between them. However, there is no true zero point, meaning zero does not indicate an absence of the attribute. An example is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
    -   **Ratio data** is similar to interval data but has a true zero point, representing an absence of the attribute. Ratios between values are meaningful. Examples include height, weight and age.
-   Values
    -   **Discrete variable** consists of whole numbers or counts with distinct and separate values. Examples include the number of books owned, the number of people in a group or the number of items sold.
    -   **Continuous variable** can take on any value within a range and is not limited to whole numbers. Examples include temperature measured in decimals, time and distance.
-   Statistical analysis
    -   **Descriptive statistics** involves summarising and describing data to gain insights into its central tendency, variability and distribution. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation and percentiles. Descriptive statistics help researchers understand data patterns and draw preliminary conclusions, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.
        -   **Table** is a widely used format for presenting descriptive statistics. It effectively summarises and analyses data, providing valuable insights into the central tendency, variability and distribution of a dataset. The standard format includes various measures that aid in comprehending the data.
        -   **Graphs** are valuable for presenting descriptive statistics and helping understand data. Common types include histograms for distribution, box plots for summaries and comparisons, scatter plots for relationships between continuous variables, bar charts for comparing categories, pie charts for proportions, line graphs for trends over time, heat maps for patterns in large datasets and scatter plot matrices for relationships between multiple variables. They simplify complex information and make it easy to grasp.
    -   **Inferential statistics** goes beyond describing data and allows researchers to draw conclusions and predictions about larger populations based on a sample. Key concepts include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, statistical significance and proper sampling methods. It is widely used in scientific research and various fields to make informed decisions and predictions with limited data.
        -   **Chi-squared test** is a statistical method used to examine the association between two categorical variables. It helps researchers determine if the observed data distribution differs significantly from the expected distribution, assuming no relationship between the variables. By analysing data in a contingency table, the test provides a p-value, indicating the significance level. A low p-value suggests a meaningful association between the variables. The chi-squared test is widely used in social sciences, market research and medical studies to analyse categorical data and draw meaningful conclusions.
        -   **T-test** is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if there is a significant difference between them. It is commonly used when analysing numerical data from two independent groups. By calculating a *t*-value and comparing it to a critical value or *p*-value, researchers can assess the statistical significance of the difference in means. The *t*-test is a fundamental tool for making informed decisions and drawing conclusions in various research scenarios.
        -   **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of multiple groups simultaneously. It helps identify significant differences in user experience across various design variations or user groups. Using ANOVA, researchers can pinpoint impactful design elements or user segments, enabling data-driven decisions for an improved UX design process.
        -   **Correlation analysis** measures how two variables are related. The correlation coefficient *r* ranges from -1 to +1, indicating whether they increase or decrease together. It's useful for finding patterns and associations between variables in different fields, but remember that correlation doesn't prove causation. More investigation is required to establish causation.
        -   **Regression analysis** estimates relationships between a dependent variable and independent variables. It finds the best-fitting line or hyperplane using mathematical criteria like ordinary least squares. This helps predict the dependent variable's value when independent variables have specific values. Regression serves two purposes: prediction and forecasting, like machine learning, and inferring causal relationships. Researchers must justify using regression for prediction or causality, especially with observational data.
        -   **Confidence interval** is a range of estimated values for an unknown parameter. The typical confidence level is 95%, but other levels like 90% or 99% are used. The confidence level indicates the proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter value. The width of the confidence interval is influenced by sample size, variability and confidence level. A larger sample size narrows the interval, while more variability or a higher confidence level widens it.
-   Common quantitative methods
    -   **Surveys** are versatile research tools that can be both qualitative and quantitative, depending on the question format used. They are cost-effective and enable reaching a large group of people simultaneously. Surveys can be designed with scripted questions for standardised responses or open-ended questions to capture natural use and diverse opinions.
    -   **MaxDiff** (Maximum Difference Scaling) is a survey technique used in market research and psychology to understand people's preferences among a set of items. Respondents are asked to choose the most preferred and least preferred items, allowing researchers to determine the relative importance of each item. MaxDiff is valuable for understanding consumer preferences, product features or brand perception. It provides essential insights for decision-making and product development based on relative ranking and comparison.
    -   **A/B testing** is a method that compares two versions of a product by presenting them to users to determine which one performs better or is preferred more. This technique allows researchers to assess the impact of different variables or design choices. A/B testing can be conducted with scripted conditions for standardised comparisons or in a natural use environment to understand user preferences in real-world settings.
    -   **Web Analytics** is the process of measuring, collecting, analysing and reporting web data to understand and optimise web usage. It goes beyond just measuring web traffic and can be used for business and market research, as well as evaluating and improving website effectiveness. This valuable tool helps researchers gain insights into user behaviour and preferences in real-world settings.
    -   **Eye tracking** is a method used to measure where people look, how long they focus on something and more. It provides a view of what captures users' visual attention, whether it's a product, website, or any other visual stimulus. Eye tracking can be done in controlled, scripted conditions for specific comparisons or in natural use environments to understand users' visual behaviour and preferences in real-world settings.
    -   **Quantitative usability testing** is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal is to gather direct input on how real users interact with the system. It involves recording quantitative measures like system usability score or user experience questionnaire, as a post-task assessment. Usability testing can be conducted with scripted conditions to ensure standardised comparisons and observations.
-   HEART framework is a user experience measurement model developed by Rodden and colleagues (2010)[^2] from Google. It helps assess the success of a product or service using user-centric metrics. It's widely used in user research to evaluate user satisfaction, measure the impact of design changes, and make informed decisions.
    -   **Happiness** measures user satisfaction and happiness with the product or service. It aims to understand how well the user's emotional needs are met and how positively they perceive the overall experience. Common metrics used for assessing happiness include user satisfaction surveys and customer feedback.
    -   **Engagement** gauges how involved and interested users are with the product or service. It helps evaluate if users find the content or feature compelling enough to keep them engaged. Metrics such as time spent on the product, number of visits and user interactions can be used to measure engagement.
    -   **Adoption** metrics assess how well users adopt and use the product or service. It provides insights into the initial onboarding experience and the number of users successfully integrating the product into their routine. Metrics like sign-ups, account creations or downloads are commonly used to evaluate adoption.
    -   **Retention** focuses on user loyalty and the ability to retain users over time. It measures the rate at which users return to the product or service for repeated interactions. Retention is critical for long-term success and is often measured using metrics like churn rate and user retention over a specific period.
    -   **Task success** evaluates how effectively users can accomplish specific tasks or goals within the product or service. This element helps identify usability issues and areas for improvement. Metrics like task completion rates and time to complete tasks are commonly used to assess task success.
-   Goals-signals-metrics process, part of the HEART framework, is designed to enhance user research. It comprises setting long-term goals, identifying success signals and tracking relevant metrics. By adopting this process, product teams can effectively assess and improve the user experience of their products.
    -   **Goals** can be outcomes or outputs. Outcomes are specific and help teams focus on achieving clear targets, while outputs lack clarity and may not define success well. By prioritising clear outcomes, businesses can improve strategy effectiveness and achieve growth more effectively. Setting the right goals is crucial for a company's success.
    -   **Signals** are crucial for evaluating progress and identifying areas to improve. Positive user feedback shows success, while issues or bugs indicate areas that need attention. An increased product rating signifies improved user satisfaction. Metrics, like signals, provide valuable insights, and they don't have to be quantitative. Both signals and metrics are vital for assessing and enhancing the user experience.
    -   **Metrics** are quantitative data used to measure various aspects of a product's performance. User experience metrics, like feature adoption rate and task completion time, assess user experience. Financial metrics, such as customer acquisition costs, reveal user profitability. Choose relevant metrics aligned with your goals and track user actions for accurate measurement.
-   User experience metrics
    -   **Descriptive metrics** provide specific insights into user behaviour and system performance. For example, waiting time measures the time users spend waiting for a response or service. Average spent time reveals how long users typically stay on a website or perform specific actions. Website visits count the number of times users access the website, while usage metrics track how users interact with the product or service. Lastly, page visits indicate the number of pages users navigate within the website. These metrics offer objective data without interpretation, enabling a clear understanding of user actions and system usage.
    -   **Perception metrics** measure how customers think and feel about their experiences. Factors like messages or music during a wait can influence how they perceive the waiting time. Metrics such as customer satisfaction, system usability scale and net promoter score gather subjective feedback to understand the overall customer experience and loyalty. By capturing these perceptions, businesses can identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall user experience.
    -   **Outcome metrics** are measurements that evaluate how users behave after their experience with a product or service. They help understand how users interact with the interface, achieve their goals efficiently and effectively and take actions like making purchases or becoming loyal customers. These metrics are crucial in assessing the impact of user experience design on user behaviour and business goals.

### Context of use

-   **Scripted use** of the product is commonly employed in lab-based or usability studies, focusing on testing or examining specific aspects of the product. This approach allows researchers to control and standardise the testing process, ensuring the desired aspects are thoroughly assessed.
-   **Natural use** of the product involves testing products in a real-world or near-natural setting with minimal interference from researchers. This method provides highly valid data as users interact with the product in authentic contexts. However, the drawback is that researchers cannot ask clarifying questions to users during the process, potentially limiting the depth of insights obtained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applied research focuses on practical problem-solving and finding real-world solutions. Its primary goal is to address specific issues, improve processes or develop new products and technologies. Unlike pure research, applied research is directly connected to making tangible improvements and positive impacts in various fields. It uses existing theories and knowledge as a foundation to generate actionable results and practical insights.

User research as part of applied research can be classified into various types, each serving specific purposes and providing unique insights. Some common types of user research include:

| Generative research | Evaluative research | Research approaches |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Exploratory         | Formative           | Traditional         |
| Explanatory         | Summative           | Agile               |

: Types of user research

### Generative research

This type of research focused on generating new ideas and insights during the early stages of product development. It aims to explore user needs and behaviours through qualitative methods like interviews and observations. By uncovering user context and pain points, generative research inspires creative and user-centred design solutions, leading to more effective and meaningful products or services.

-   **Exploratory research** often qualitative is a preliminary and open-ended investigation that aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of a topic or problem. It uses qualitative methods to generate insights, ideas and hypotheses, rather than testing specific hypotheses or making definitive conclusions. The insights from exploratory research provide a solid foundation for further investigation and decision-making in subsequent research studies.
-   **Explanatory research** often quantitative aims to provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables and uncover the reasons behind observed phenomena. It goes beyond exploratory research to establish cause-and-effect relationships and test specific hypotheses. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, explanatory research helps researchers make predictions and draw conclusions about the effects of variables on outcomes. It plays a crucial role in confirming or refuting existing theories and guiding future research and decision-making.

### Evaluative research

This type of research focuses on assessing and judging the effectiveness and impact of existing products, services or interventions. Unlike exploratory or explanatory research, which seeks to understand phenomena. Evaluative research aims to make informed decisions and improve designs based on collected data. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, it gathers feedback from users or participants to refine and optimise products or services, measure intervention impact and ensure they meet user needs and expectations. Evaluative research plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making and enhancing the overall user experience.

-   **Formative research** often qualitative is conducted in the early stages of a project or program to gather insights and feedback that inform its development and design. It focuses on understanding the target audience's needs and behaviours, using qualitative and quantitative methods like interviews and surveys. By involving users and stakeholders, formative research ensures that the final product or program is well-informed and relevant, leading to more effective solutions and successful outcomes.
-   **Summative research** often quantitative evaluates the overall effectiveness and impact of a project, program or intervention at its conclusion. Unlike formative research, which informs the design, summative research measures the extent to which objectives have been achieved. It uses quantitative methods like surveys and assessments to collect data and draw conclusions about the success of the initiative. The insights from summative research are valuable for stakeholders, guiding future improvements and decision-making based on the project's outcomes.

### Research approaches

-   **Traditional approach** is the usual way of doing research, following a step-by-step process. It includes planning, data collection, analysis and reporting in a specific order. It has a fixed design and is focused on getting accurate results, but it may take longer because it's less flexible.
-   **Agile approach** is a flexible and adaptive approach to research, inspired by agile software development. It breaks down the process into smaller tasks, allowing continuous data gathering and analysis. Researchers can make real-time adjustments based on insights, focusing on high-priority areas. It is valuable in dynamic environments with evolving research questions.
